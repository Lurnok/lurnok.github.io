            <p>
                Brainfuck is an <b>esolang</b>, which means "esoteric programming language". Those are languages,
                not meant to be used, that are either funny, stupid, conceptual or that want to showcase a cool concept.
                I like those a lot and often read articles about them on the <a href="">official esolang wiki</a>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Brainfuck functions, in it's basic form, by working on a array of <b>30 thousands</b> cells.
                Each cell has a value, ranging from <b>0 to 255</b>. When the program starts, every cell has a value of 0,
                the language works by affecting those values and outputing them, with a set of very few, very simple, instructions.
