                What is brainfuck ?
            </h1>
            <p>
                Brainfuck is an <b>esolang</b>, which means "esoteric programming language". Those are languages,
                not meant to be used, that are either funny, stupid, conceptual or that want to showcase a cool concept.
                I like those a lot and often read articles about them on the <a target="_blank" href="https://esolangs.org">official esolang wiki</a>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Brainfuck functions, in it's basic form, by working on a array of <b>30 thousands</b> cells.
                Each cell has a value, ranging from <b>0 to 255</b>. When the program starts, every cell has a value of 0, and a <b>pointer</b> is positionned on cell 0.
                The language works by affecting those values and outputing them, with a set of very few, very simple, instructions :

                <ul>
                    <li><b> > </b>   : move the pointer one cell to the <b>right</b></li>
                    <li><b> < </b>   : move the pointer one cell to the <b>left</b></li>
                    <li><b> + </b>   : <b>increment</b> the value of the pointed cell</li>
                    <li><b> - </b>   : <b>decrement</b> the value of the pointed cell</li>
                    <li><b> . </b>   : <b>outputs</b> the value of the pointed cell</li>
                    <li><b> , </b>   : takes <b>user input</b> and stores it in the pointed cell</li>
                    <li><b> []</b>   : These are for <b>loops</b>, i'll explain how they work later</li>

            How do you program things then ?
            <p>
                Well, I don't really know, I only know how to ouptut text. Since every cell has a value that can go from
                0 to 255, the <b>.</b> instruction outputs to the console the <b>ASCII table</b> character corresponding to said value.
            </p>
            <p>
                People have done crazy things with this language like an <b>if condition</b>, only with the instructions explained above,
                which is super impressive to me. I have however no idea how it works.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't need to understand the complex algorithms created by the community to write an interpretor, only the way the basic components
                of this language works.

                What is an interpretor ?
            </h1>
            <p>
                There are two major types of programming languages :
                <ul>
                    <li>Compiled language (C, C++, Java, ...)</li>
                    <li>Interpreted languages (JavaScript, Python, ...)</li>
                </ul>
                Compiled languages go through a compiler which will create an executable based on the program
                while Interpreted languages are read by an interpretor, that executes the code itself.
                <br>
                So an interpretor is a program that reads the code from the source file, understands it, and exectutes it.
                I decided, as a challenge to myself, to write myself an interpretor. Since an interpretor for a complex language
                is a massive project, I chose to write a Brainfuck interpretor, which would be easier, but still challenging.
            </p>

        <div class="article">
            <h1>
                Unfuck
            </h1>
            <p>
                I chose to do this project in C++, a low level compiled language that is perfectly suited for interpretor (though
                nowadays, Rust is preffered for those, might rewrite Unfuck in it someday). 
                <br><br>
                There are two main classes to make this work, <b>Cells</b>, representing the array and <b>SrcIterator</b>, to
                act on the source file code and execute it, basically SrcIterator reads the code and acts on Cells.
                <br>
                First the argument passed while executing the program is checked, to see if it is a valid path to a <b>.bf</b> file,
                the brainfuck extension, if not, then the execution is stopped and an error message is shown. Then the <b>Cells</b>
                are initiallized, and the text in the <b>.bf</b> file is stored in a member attribute of the <b>SrcIterator</b>
                class. The brainfuck code is then checked for error (added in the famous <b>debugginator</b> update), that means a bracket
                that is mismatched (loop that is not closed or that is never opened in the first place), a few weeks ago this security was
                not here and a faulty program would cause an infinite loop and probably a substancial amount of memory leak.
                Then if there is no problem, the <b>SrcIterator</b> class will take the first instruction (easy, they are only single-character
                instructions), execute it and then <b>consume</b> it (remove it from the list) and do this until there is none left.
                <br><br>
                Only problem, <b>loops</b>.
                <br>
                The way they work in brainfuck is a bit weird. A loop is delimited by two brackets ( <b>[stuff to loop]</b> ), and 
                when the cell the pointer is at the end of an iteration of the loop has a value of <b>0</b>, exit the loop.
                Easy enough, just store the string  between brackets in a variable and execute it in a while loop with a "<b>> 0</b>"
                condition. It works just fine but when it comes to nested loops, my first solution was kinda broken. 
                This was a bit of a nightmare to fix, since I was working with recursion (functions calling themselves) but ended up finding 
                a way to make it work, by divinding the work between different functions with clear goals to make it easier to see
                where the problem was (it was something so dumb I don't want to mention it here).
                <br><br>
                I swear when I used it to execute Brainfuck code and it worked for the first time it felt so good.

                Conclusion
            </h1>
            <p>
                This is honestly not a good interpretor (well it gets the job done) but I did this project mainly to challenge
                myself to do something I had no idea how it worked in a language I barely knew at the time.
                This taught me a lot about how interpretors work (even though no <b>parsing</b> is needed here, while 
                it is mandatory for a complete language interpretor), and gave me a good basic understanding of C++.
            </p>
            <p>
                Possible evolutions :
                <ul>
                    <li>Rewrite it in Rust (this would take a long time so not for now)</li>
                    <li>Make the settings customizable with a config file</li>
                    <li>Improve the debugger (like make it able to tell you <b>WHERE</b> the problem is, not only that there is one)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            I'll sometimes continue working on this, and I'll make sure to update this page when I do so.
