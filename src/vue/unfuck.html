                What is brainfuck ?
            </h1>
            <p>
                Brainfuck is an <b>esolang</b>, which means "esoteric programming language". Those are languages,
                not meant to be used, that are either funny, stupid, conceptual or that want to showcase a cool concept.
                I like those a lot and often read articles about them on the <a href="">official esolang wiki</a>.

                Brainfuck functions, in it's basic form, by working on a array of <b>30 thousands</b> cells.
                Each cell has a value, ranging from <b>0 to 255</b>. When the program starts, every cell has a value of 0, and a <b>pointer</b> is positionned on cell 0.
                The language works by affecting those values and outputing them, with a set of very few, very simple, instructions :

                    <li><b> > </b>   : move the pointer one cell to the <b>right</b></li>
                    <li><b> < </b>   : move the pointer one cell to the <b>left</b></li>
                    <li><b> + </b>   : <b>increment</b> the value of the pointed cell</li>
                    <li><b> - </b>   : <b>decrement</b> the value of the pointed cell</li>
                    <li><b> . </b>   : <b>outputs</b> the value of the pointed cell</li>
                    <li><b> , </b>   : takes <b>user input</b> and stores it in the pointed cell</li>
                    <li><b> []</b>   : These are for <b>loops</b>, i'll explain how they work later</li>
