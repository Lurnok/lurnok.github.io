            <p>
                My name is Lucas, I am a 20 year old IT student and dev enthusiast.    
                I am currently on my second year of bachelor even though I graduated high school 4 years ago. 
                I don't know what I'm gonna do with this website but at least it's here, maybe I'll talk about my projects and stuff I like.
                And maybe one day I will try to make this a bit more serious and include it in my resume but for now : <a href="src/vue/forg.html">Forg</a>

                <h1>Projects</h1>
                <p>
                    I spend quite some of my free time on a variety of personnal projects, here you will be able to see some of my favorite (when I complete them).

                <p>
                    I enjoy a lot of niche things and I can never stop talking about them so here will be random stuff about those things.
